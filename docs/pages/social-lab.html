                    OTP Bank asked us to create the foundation for a long-term
                    Social Lab: a new organisational model designed to help the
                    bank respond to complex social challenges in a more
                    coordinated, proactive, and impact-driven way. Our role was
                    to build the full framework—from the strategic intent to the
                    operational structure—ensuring the Lab becomes a credible
                    engine for social innovation inside the bank.

        <p class="c-background">
            Over several months, we worked with a dedicated cross-departmental
            team, running a series of workshops, interviews, and expert
            consultations. These sessions explored OTP’s existing social
            activities, internal expectations, ESG commitments, and ecosystem
            relationships. We mapped the bank’s touchpoints across NGOs,
            municipalities, academia, and rural communities to understand where
            the Lab could create real, systemic value.
        </p>
        <p class="c-background">
            Based on this research, we defined the Lab’s governance model,
            methodological backbone, manifesto, impact areas, and operating
            principles. We produced the official Playbook, the internal
            onboarding materials, and a complete concept for piloting and
            scaling the Lab—from the first MVP projects to long-term integration
            into the bank’s strategy and Responsible Banking commitments.
        </p>
        <p class="c-background">
            The resulting framework enables OTP to shift from fragmented,
            donation-led activities to a structured, measurable, and
            participatory model that supports real solutions for financial
            inclusion, local communities, and climate-related vulnerabilities.

                    We delivered a validated, organisation-ready Social Lab
                    framework with clear governance, guidance, and processes.
                    This gave OTP a coherent model for initiating, testing, and
                    scaling socially impactful projects that integrate existing
                    expertise and ecosystem strengths.

                    The Social Lab creates a pathway for OTP to move toward
                    proactive, measurable social value creation—supporting
                    financial inclusion, community resilience, and long-term ESG
                    goals while strengthening partnerships across society.
