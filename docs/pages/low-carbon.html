                        The carbon footprint of our devices and the internet, as
                        an ecosystem behind them, account for over 3.5% of the
                        global carbon output. But Internet is not an autonomous
                        being with its own will - it’s merely the sum of all the
                        decisions made by software developers, web designers,
                        marketing departments, publishers and internet users.

                        To be a sustainable business, we need to make sure our
                        website has the smallest possible carbon footprint,
                        while maintaining easy access to our content for our
                        visitors.

                    <p>
                        The biggest energy vampire of a website is the server it
                        is hosted on - so however we are reducing our energy
                        needs, we still need to make sure that energy comes from
                        responsible sources. We are hosting our website with a
                        hosting provider running on certified renewable energy
                        source.

                    <h4>DITHERED IMAGES</h4>
                    <p>
                        The biggest data load on websites is created by the
                        transmission of images. This is getting worse every
                        year: as our devices get better screens with greater
                        resolution, websites need to get higher resolution
                        images for an acceptable look. We eliminated a large
                        portion of the images on our website, and the ones we
                        kept, we are also compressing with a really oldschool
                        image compression technique called dithering. By
                        dithering, we can make images less resource-intensive to
                        a ridiculous degree, even when they are displayed quite
                        large. The number of colours in an image, combined with
                        its file format and resolution, contributes to the size
                        of an image. Thus, instead of using full-colour
                        high-resolution images, we chose to convert all images
                        to monochrome, with only black and transparent color -
                        all else is created in CSS. We are also compressing
                        images with a lossy webp codec, making them another
                        20-30% smaller, and including them inline in base64, to
                        reduce the number of requests even further.

                    <h4>DEFAULT TYPEFACE</h4>
                    <p>
                        All resources loaded, including typefaces, are an
                        additional request to the server, requiring storage
                        space and energy use. Therefore, our website does not
                        load a custom typeface and removes the font-family
                        declaration, meaning that visitors will see the default
                        typefaces of their browser, a mono, sans-serif and a
                        serif font.

                        Obviously. At least not in the usual sense. Our logo on
                        the website is generated from the default fonts on your
                        computer, so it may look a bit different for different
                        people.

                    <h4>NO TRACKING</h4>
                    <p>
                        Web analysis software such as Google Analytics, Hotjar,
                        Facebook Pixel records what happens on a website — which
                        pages are most viewed, where visitors come from, and so
                        on. These services would make our lives easier by
                        providing insight to analyse our CRM operations,
                        advertising, or our website in general. However,
                        exchanging these data generates extra data traffic and
                        thus energy use. These tracking codes also generate
                        additional load on the client computer (i.e., your
                        browser), further adding to the carbon footprint of our
                        website. Therefore, we decided to run our website
                        without any external tracking, and without setting any
                        cookies (except a session cookie needed for the contact
                        form) in your browser, and only using our (very
                        anonymous) server logs for analytics. This isn’t just
                        great for the environment, but also gives you additional
                        privacy, and removes the need for those annoying cookie
                        warnings.

                    <h4>NO CMS</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most of today’s websites use extensive server side
                        programming and database operations that generate the
                        website on the fly - most often through a CMS. This
                        means that every time someone visits a web page, it is
                        generated on demand. Sure, this kind of operation makes
                        website management much easier, but in our case, the
                        benefits don’t outweigh the environmental costs. So our
                        website is run with a majority of basic HTML and CSS
                        code, with some JS for interactivity on the frontend,
                        and a couple of lines of PHP in the backend for things
                        like form submission. Besides reducing the carbon
                        footprint, this makes our website much more secure.

                    <h4>MINIMAL JS</h4>
                    <p>
                        All those animations you see in your browser every day
                        are generated by JS - and very often through loading a
                        couple of huge JS libraries in your browser. This kind
                        of animation is also rarely optimized properly, meaning
                        it uses an extreme amount of resources on your side. To
                        fight this, we minimised the use of any JS on our
                        website, and the ones we have are created with vanilla
                        JS and HTML/CSS.

                    <h4>LIGHT AND DARK</h4>
                    <p>
                        It’s quite a tricky question whether dark themed
                        websites actually consume less energy or not. With the
                        introduction of modern screen technologies where black
                        pixels actually mean a LED being turned off (like
                        AMOLED), there seems to be a considerable advantage with
                        dark modes. On the other hand, if you are in a dark
                        environment, it is much more comfortable reading a white
                        text over a black background, requiring less brightness
                        from our devices, therefore reducing energy consumption;
                        while if you are in a light environment, the opposite is
                        much better. So rather than going full dark, we decided
                        to go with a different approach, and have 4 different
                        color schemes changing through the day, depending on the
                        usual color temperature of natural light at different
                        times of day - always presenting the site with the color
                        scheme with the highest contrast potential - so you
                        should not need a very high brightness. Of course in the
                        evening it will switch to dark mode.
