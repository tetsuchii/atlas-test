                        acquainted to our Magical Menagerie* Collection of Supercool Creatures! Don’t worry, their

                    <p>She is the greatest predator of her age. Out of fear of extinction, she decided to add a magical
                        horn to her toolkit of (already extremely advanced) set of senses. By the pricking of her horn,
                        she is able to predict the approach of anything wicked by nature. She also loves dogs.</p>

                    <p>Cassius is guarding all of our doors. He does this by his own choice - nobody is forcing him
                        to do that. He’s just really great at it because he grew an extra head, so he can literally
                        see behind his back, while also keeping his eyes on whatever’s ahead.</p>

                    <p>Remény is the sweetest of all the cats we have ever met. Standing at a height of 103 cm and
                        with a wingspan of 2.5 meters, she can catch even the largest and fastest balls of yarn. She
                        also developed the ability to breath fire, in an effort to protect her from larger
                        predators. </p>
