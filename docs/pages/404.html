                We don’t send newsletters because, well, it’s 2022 and there is
                a really slim chance of you ever opening one. Also mass emails
                require servers, servers require electricity… you know the rest.
                So if you would like to hear updates from us, you can follow us

                We are a remote first company, most of the time you can find us
                in Budapest, Hungary. We do most of our work in Europe (because
                time zones), but feel free to contact us from anywhere, we will
                find a way to sort it out.
