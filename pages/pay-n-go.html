                    BKK asked us to examine how travellers encounter and engage
                    with Budapest Pay&GO across the ecosystem of screens, signs,
                    and street-level interactions. We approached the service as
                    a complex system rather than a set of isolated interfaces,
                    mapping how digital design, physical touchpoints and user
                    expectations shape one another in real use.

            Over five days of field research, we observed and intercepted
            hundreds of riders—mostly visitors navigating an unfamiliar
            city—capturing the subtle behaviours and misunderstandings that
            don’t appear in controlled environments. In parallel, we conducted a
            detailed audit of the Pay&GO digital experience: websites,
            validators, the information architecture behind the service, and the
            customer portal where trust is either reinforced or lost.
        </p>
        <p class="c-background">
            We also analysed communication materials, naming conventions, and
            brand cues to understand how the service is framed in the minds of
            users. By combining these layers—heuristics, analytics, field
            insight, and usability testing—we produced a clear set of directions
            to make Pay&GO more intuitive, legible, and aligned with how people
            move through complex urban systems.

                    We delivered a consolidated insight base and focused UX
                    recommendations that strengthened clarity, reduced friction,
                    and supported BKK in improving Pay&GO’s overall service
                    experience.

                    A clearer, more comprehensible Pay&GO system encourages
                    wider adoption of fast, paperless public transport options
                    and builds long-term trust in digital mobility services.
