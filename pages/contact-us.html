                    T*or any of the numerous remote meeting tools that have been
                    making our lives wonderful for the past three years. But be
                    prepared to be judged by your virtual background - and we
                    can tell if you aren’t really sitting on a beach among palm

                We don’t send newsletters because, well, it’s 2025 and there is
                a really slim chance of you ever opening one. Also mass emails
                require servers, servers require electricity… you know the rest.
                So if you would like to hear updates from us, you can follow us
                on:
                <a
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/atlas-rise"

                We are a remote first company, most of the time you can find us
                in Budapest, Hungary. We do most of our work in Europe (because
                time zones), but feel free to contact us from anywhere, we will
                find a way to sort it out.
