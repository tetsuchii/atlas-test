                    Mastercard invited us to create a thought-leadership
                    whitepaper that reframes cybercrime as a systemic,
                    ecosystem-level challenge rather than a purely technical
                    issue. We conducted extensive research combining
                    Mastercard’s Cyber Insights data, market analysis, expert
                    interviews, and a population-level digital security survey
                    to understand how cybercrime evolves across tactics,
                    techniques, and procedures.

            Our team synthesized global threat trends with the everyday
            realities of users and service providers, revealing how automation,
            AI, and criminal collaboration reshape the cybersecurity landscape.
            We translated these findings into a clear narrative structure
            supported by actionable frameworks bridging the gap between
            professionals and business decisionmakers through a common TTP model
            to help organizations see where their responsibilities lie and how
            their decisions affect the broader digital ecosystem.

            The whitepaper was designed as a public resource: accessible enough
            for consumers and SMEs, yet strategic enough for regulators,
            financial institutions, and enterprise leaders. It became a core
            piece of Mastercard’s communication, workshop materials, and
            educational outreach across the region. You can also read it here:

                    By clarifying the shared responsibilities across users,
                    businesses, and public institutions, the material supports
                    more resilient digital behavior, fosters cross-sector
                    collaboration, and encourages the adoption of safer, more
                    secure digital practices across society.
