                We have been active in the cybersecurity space for ages
                (especially in human factors and cybersecurity product
                management/innovation). We are also founders of the
                <a href="http://www.cyberislands.org">Cyber Islands </a>
                community, and we have our spinoff,
                <a href="http://arx3.com">ARX3</a> focused on services for the
                cybersecurity space.

                        of our colleagues, including our interns fresh out of
                        university, are also AI experts with 10+ years of
                        experience in AI (which they traded in for 10+ years of
                        experience in cypto and NFT in 2022). If that was not
                        clear enough, we can totally prove it with this
