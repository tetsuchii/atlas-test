                    SOS Children’s Villages invited us to conduct an in-depth
                    research project to better understand and improve the donor
                    experience across both online and offline touchpoints. The
                    goal was to capture the motivations, expectations, and
                    behaviours of donors, while also identifying global trends
                    shaping the future of digital giving.

            Through qualitative interviews, field observations of on-street
            fundraising, and an extensive desktop trend review, we examined how
            trust is formed, what drives donors to commit, and how technology
            and communication influence the giving journey. Our work covered the
            full donor lifecycle—from awareness to long-term
            engagement—revealing where friction, confusion, or missed
            opportunities appeared.

        <p class="c-background">
            The insights allowed us to highlight actionable directions for
            improving messaging, strengthening donor relationships, and
            preparing the organisation for modern, mobile-first donation flows.
            The research now serves as a strategic foundation for SOS as they
            evolve their digital fundraising efforts.

                    The research clarified where donor trust and engagement can
                    be strengthened, and revealed opportunities to simplify
                    digital donation flows. The organisation gained a clearer,
                    more structured understanding of how to modernise the donor
                    experience in line with international best practices.

                    receive stable and sustainable support.
