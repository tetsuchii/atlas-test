                    The “Rewilding at Balaton” initiative, in collaboration with
                    Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, explores how the
                    rediscovery and use of edible wild plants can strengthen the
                    climate resilience of local communities in the Balaton
                    region. In a time of shifting ecological conditions,
                    biodiversity loss and eroding local knowledge, the project
                    combines ecological research, hands-on community workshops,
                    and culinary experimentation to re-establish a deep,
                    reciprocal relationship between humans and their surrounding
                    ecosystems. By engaging directly with wild plants—through
                    foraging, identification, and preparation—participants
                    reconnect with seasonal cycles, soil health, and the rich
                    diversity of local flora.

            Edible wild plants—once an integral part of daily diets and
            traditional knowledge—are reintroduced not as nostalgic curiosities,
            but as living tools for resilience, nutrition, and cultural
            continuity. The project emphasizes the importance of sustainable
            harvesting, local knowledge preservation, and awareness of the
            ecological functions of native species. Through participatory
            activities, the initiative encourages people to reflect on their
            consumption habits, food sovereignty, and the broader role of
            biodiversity in supporting both human and ecological well-being. In
            doing so, “Rewilding at Balaton” fosters not only a practical
            reconnection with nature, but also a deeper ecological and cultural
            consciousness that strengthens local identity and community
            cohesion.

                    The project is generating a growing network of local
                    actors—farmers, chefs, teachers, and young people—who now
                    recognize the ecological and social value of wild food. We
                    are about to launch a new collective platform that includes
                    a digital herbarium, community recipe collections, and new
                    partnerships between local institutions and environmental
                    initiatives.

                    “Rewilding at Balaton” is helping to reconnect communities
                    with their ecological surroundings and to view biodiversity
                    as a source of resilience rather than scarcity. The
                    initiative strengthens local identity, increases awareness
                    of food sovereignty, and demonstrates how cultural revival
                    can serve as an adaptive response to climate change.
